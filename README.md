* This is a cipher algorithm which uses "JunTai(like Shuffle)" distribution random number algorithm and multi secret key table to encrypt and decrypt.
* The so-called "JunTai" distribution random number algorithm refers to: each number (integer or real number) is distributed disorderly on the number axis, its value appears only once without repetition.
* The secret key table of this algorithm is not limited to 8, it can be more than one.
* The algorithm is a bit like packet encryption and decryption algorithm, which can process data in parallel.

* It's just a demo version, the official version includes lower version, intermediate version and advanced version.
* If you want to source code of official version, please contact me.
* I hope who can crack this algorithm one day in my lifetime.
* If you break this algorithm, please let me know. Thank you very so much!

* Lang.c is a improved version of this demo.
* Multiple passwords of the "Lang" algorithm are generated using a one-time password algorithm.

* Compiled on MacOS, Linux and *BSD in X86_64 platform.
